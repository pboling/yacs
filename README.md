# YACS - Yet Another Crypto Scanner

## Overview

This app is a single-page React application (Rolldown-Vite-based) designed to display and manage real-time token data.
It features robust filtering, sorting, and live updates via WebSocket, with a focus on usability and responsiveness.

## Technical Approach

### Dependencies

Only four runtime dependencies are used, to limit the attack surface, the bug surface,
maximize performance with browser native tools, and leverage cross compatibility:

- @tanstack/react-virtual - rows outside the view become viewtualized, but still attacked to their hooks and events; some have conditions on whether they are visible.
- lucide-react - lightweight SVG icon library.
- react - No time for an essay here, but it's React, and you've already heard of it.
- react-dom - React DOM bindings.

üéâ No additional Javascript libraries are used.
üéâ No CSS frameworks are used.

### Real-time Updates
- **WebSocket Subscription:** The app subscribes to relevant WebSocket events to receive live updates for token price, volume, and new token additions.
- **Dynamic Data Handling:** Token data is updated in real-time, with sorting and filtering maintained as new data arrives.
- **Efficient State Management:** Ensures UI remains consistent and performant during frequent updates.
- **Real-time Performance:** Can handle 50,000 web socket updates per minute (I stopped testing there, might handle more!).

### Filtering & Sorting
- **Client-side Filtering:** Users can filter tokens by chain (ETH, SOL, BASE, BSC), minimum volume, maximum age, minimum market cap, and exclude honeypots.
- **Server-side Sorting:** Client side sorting for speed.
- **Responsive Controls:** Filtering controls are intuitive and update the table instantly.

### UI/UX
- **Loading States:** Visual indicators during data fetches and updates.
- **Error States:** Clear messaging and recovery options for API/WebSocket errors.
- **Empty States:** Informative UI when no tokens match the filters.
- **Color Coding:** Price changes are color-coded and themaable (e.g., green for up, red for down) for quick visual feedback.
- **A11y (Accessibility):** Entire app is themed with multiple themes friendly to colorblind users (orange/blue, yellow/purple).

## Main Features
1. **React App:** Runnable SPA with tables and filters.
2. **API Integration:** REST API calls for initial and filtered data.
3. **WebSocket Integration:** Real-time updates for token data.
4. **Styling:** Clean, modern UI with flexible styling options.
5. **Documentation:** This README, [DETAILS.md](DETAILS.md), unit and e2e tests, and in-code comments.
6. **Error Handling:** Robust error states and recovery mechanisms.

## Bonus Features
- **Unit Tests:** Node tests for coverage of key components and logic.
- **Integration Tests:** Vitest for key component integrations and behaviors.
- **E2E Tests:** Coverage for full stack functionality, via playwright.
- **Mock Server Backend:** Tests run against a mock server, fixtures, or configurable live server.
- **Mock Server Frontend:** Auto Tick feature to allow front-end realism when the WebSocket isn't pushing events. (NOTE: This is an interface demo, not a real product!)
- **Websocket Console:** Debug tool for tracking outgoing and incoming WebSocket messages.
- **WS Subscription Throttle:** Test the limits of performance.
- **Per-Row Manual WS Subscription:** Each row can have its subscriptions turned off and on (sticky).
- **Fresh column:** Sort by data freshness, rows pop to the top of the table when they receive updates.
- **WS Subscription Monitoring:** Various debug tools, and hidden URL params, provide additional console logging, and visibility into the WebSocket connection.
- **WS Subscription Management:** Subscriptions are managed to ensure visible rows are always subscribed, and a dynamically-resized and throttled FIFO stack limits the window of subscriptions for rows outside scrollpanes.
- **Chart Integration:** Mini price charts for tokens, and large price charts in a Detail / Compare modal.
- **Export Functionality:** Export token data as CSV for analysis.
- **Advanced Filtering:** Additional controls for power users.

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
2. Start the app: `pnpm run dev`, or to run the local mock server as well: `pnpm run dev:serve`
3. Run tests: `pnpm test`
